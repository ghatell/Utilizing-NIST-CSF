## üìò Introduction

In this project, I conducted a cybersecurity posture assessment for **NeoSecure Labs**, a fictional mid-sized technology research company. Acting as a **Cybersecurity Consultant**, I evaluated their current controls, policies, and security practices against the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (CSF)**.

My goal was to identify deficiencies, align security outcomes to the CSF Core Functions, and provide actionable recommendations that would move NeoSecure from a **Tier 1 (Partial)** to a **Tier 3 (Consistent)** maturity profile.

## üß© What is NIST CSF 2.0?

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a flexible, risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity. Version 2.0 introduces six **Core Functions** that organize desired outcomes and control objectives:

| Function   | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **GOVERN** | Establish risk governance, roles, and responsibilities |
| **IDENTIFY** | Understand cybersecurity risk to assets and operations |
| **PROTECT** | Safeguard assets and systems with appropriate controls |
| **DETECT** | Identify cybersecurity events quickly and accurately |
| **RESPOND** | Contain, mitigate, and analyze incidents |
| **RECOVER** | Restore capabilities and communicate post-incident |

## üè¢ Assessment Scope: NeoSecure Labs

- Industry: R&D in biotechnology and embedded systems  
- Team: 100 employees, global operations  
- Tech stack: Microsoft 365, Azure Cloud, on-prem research servers  
- No formal CISO or security program in place  
- All cybersecurity responsibility sits with the IT Manager

## üìä Profile Summary

The NIST CSF 2.0 includes a tiered maturity model that helps organizations assess the rigor and consistency of their cybersecurity governance and risk management practices. NeoSecure Labs was evaluated using these tiers to establish both its current and target cybersecurity posture.

### üß© Current Profile ‚Äì Tier 1: Partial

| Tier | Cybersecurity Risk Governance | Cybersecurity Risk Management |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Tier 1: Partial** | Application of the organizational cybersecurity risk strategy is managed in an ad hoc manner. There are no defined policies, and decision-making is reactive rather than strategic. Roles and responsibilities are either undocumented or informally assigned. Leadership involvement in cybersecurity is minimal or absent. | There is limited awareness of cybersecurity risks across the organization. Risk management is conducted irregularly and is not integrated into broader business processes. There are no formal procedures for identifying, assessing, or prioritizing cyber risks. Risk-related data is not shared effectively within the organization. Vendors and third-party risks are largely unaccounted for. |

---

### üéØ Target Profile ‚Äì Tier 3: Consistent

| Tier | Cybersecurity Risk Governance | Cybersecurity Risk Management |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Tier 3: Consistent** | The organization has documented and formalized cybersecurity governance. Policies, roles, and responsibilities are clearly defined and communicated across departments. Cybersecurity is embedded in decision-making processes at multiple levels. Risk oversight is included in strategic planning, and security objectives are aligned with business outcomes. Governance processes are regularly reviewed and updated. | Cybersecurity risk management practices are defined, implemented, and consistently followed across the organization. Risks are identified and prioritized using a repeatable process. Third-party risks are evaluated through a formal vetting program. Risk metrics are tracked, and findings inform control improvements and investment decisions. There is an established culture of risk awareness and accountability. |

> These tier definitions form the basis for NeoSecure Labs' security transformation roadmap. The goal is to evolve from a reactive posture to a

### üß± IDENTIFY

| Finding | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Assets tracked manually, no classification based on criticality | ‚ùå |
| Third-party services used without risk vetting | ‚ùå |
| No formal risk management framework in place | ‚ùå |

**Recommendation:**  
Implement asset inventory with tagging for sensitivity (e.g., PII, R&D data). Develop a third-party risk management process and align risk identification with NIST 800-30.

### üõ°Ô∏è PROTECT

| Finding | Status |
|--------|--------|
| No MFA on remote access or administrative accounts | ‚ùå |
| Shared admin credentials in use | ‚ùå |
| No data loss prevention (DLP) strategy | ‚ùå |
| Staff cybersecurity training only at onboarding | ‚ö†Ô∏è |

**Recommendation:**  
Enforce MFA using Azure AD. Deploy PAM (Privileged Access Management). Initiate DLP controls within Microsoft 365. Launch quarterly phishing simulations and exec-level security training.

### üîç DETECT

| Finding | Status |
|--------|--------|
| No SIEM or log monitoring | ‚ùå |
| Relying solely on Microsoft Defender alerts | ‚ùå |
| No defined detection thresholds or incident classification | ‚ùå |

**Recommendation:**  
Deploy SIEM (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel or Splunk). Establish baselines for normal behavior. Develop detection playbooks linked to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

---

### üö® RESPOND

| Finding | Status |
|--------|--------|
| No incident response plan (IRP) exists | ‚ùå |
| Response is reactive, uncoordinated | ‚ùå |
| No legal or regulatory response considerations | ‚ùå |

**Recommendation:**  
Develop a formal IRP using the SANS 6-step model. Train teams with tabletop exercises. Define escalation points and external communication channels.

### üîÅ RECOVER

| Finding | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Daily backups taken but not tested regularly | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| No documented disaster recovery plan | ‚ùå |

## üß† Final Thoughts

This project demonstrates the process of applying cybersecurity frameworks to assess real-world environments. By mapping technical and organizational gaps to CSF outcomes and supported control frameworks (like NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001), we can build a **measurable roadmap toward security maturity**.
